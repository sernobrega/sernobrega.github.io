      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    

<p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Sérgio. I grew up in a small Portuguese island and moved to Lisbon to study Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, where I am currently finishing my bachelors. My main interests are machine learning, data science, analytics and visualisation.</p>

<p>In my first semester of university, I joined the <a href="https://best.eu.org">Board of European Students of Technology</a> where I ended up being in the local board of Lisbon as Vice-President for Internal Support (May 2017 - May 2018). This opportunity allowed me to visit amazing countries, meet and work with people from many more and to develop my time management and soft skills brutally.</p>

<p>I would <strong>describe myself</strong> as proactive and detail-oriented. I love planning and I&rsquo;m extremely organised. I believe that work needs to be as visually pleasing as it is functional. Above all, I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m curious and inquisitive about the ways of the world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>deeply passionate</strong> about the climate change cause and I believe that machine learning will play a major role in bridging our inherent lack of knowledge about nature, providing better plans for resource usage and management.</p>

<p>Feel free to message me in any of my social media, I&rsquo;m sernobrega everywhere! Looking forward :)</p>

<h2 id="a-personal-story-about-how-i-got-to-computer-science">A personal story about how I got to Computer Science&hellip;</h2>

<p>Some of my dearest memories are me, an old computer, those CDs with dozens of games and hundreds of free hours. Because of this, while some of my school friends wanted to be cops or firefighters, I wanted to be a programmer (whatever that means to a 6-year-old).</p>

<p>In <strong>middle school</strong>, I started messing with code through Blogspot (&hellip;) where I had my first contact with HTML and CSS. I remember spending a lot of time trying to fix something very simple and failing miserably. In <strong>high school</strong>, I explored a bit of Python and PHP but nothing serious as my passion for science and maths was growing. During high school I won the 2nd and 3rd place in a Mathematics competition (<a href="http://premiopedromatos.ipleiria.pt/files/old/ppm7/index.html">2016</a>, <a href="http://premiopedromatos.ipleiria.pt/files/old/ppm6/index.html">2015</a>), 2 biology summer internships in University of Algarve and I manage to get to the final of the Portuguese Biology Olympiads, all achievements that I am very proud till this day. Because of these achievements, I got to do a radio show on the fear of students of STEM subjects and appeared in the local newspaper (how cool?!).</p>

<p>As you can imagine, by the <strong>end of high school</strong> I wanted to become a biologist (oooh). Choosing a degree became really hard because I knew I still loved computers and maths. I started to doubt my future. The only way I managed to decide was to go back to the 6-year-old that spent most of his day playing games and grew up to be more curious about computers and how they can create the world around us (and other worlds).</p>

<p>Since then, I am every day more motivated to learn more about the sea of things I still don&rsquo;t know.</p>
